# This tests the PiecewiseConstant function.
# There are four variables and four functions: a,b,c, and d.  The diffusion equation is "solved"
# for each of these variables with a boundary condition of type FunctionDirchletBC applied to a boundary
# (i.e. node set) that includes every node in the element, so the solution is the boundary condition defined by the function.
#  Each boundary condition uses a function of type PiecewiseConstant.
#
# The value of the variables should correspond to the function.
