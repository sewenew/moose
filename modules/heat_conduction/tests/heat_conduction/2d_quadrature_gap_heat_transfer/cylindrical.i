#
# RZ Gap Heat Transfer Test without mechanics
#
#
# The mesh consists of two element blocks containing ten elements each.  Each
#   element is a unit cube.  They sit next to one another with a unit between them.
#
# The conductivity of both blocks is large to achieve a uniform temperature
#  across each block. The temperature of the far left boundary
#  is ramped from 100 to 200 over one time unit, and then held fixed for an additional
#  time unit.  The temperature of the far right boundary is held fixed at 100.
#
# A simple analytical solution is possible for the heat flux between the blocks, or cylinders in the case of RZ.:
#
#  Flux = (T_left - T_right) * (gapK/(r*ln(r2/r1)))
#
# For gapK = 1 (default value)
#
# The integrated heat flux across the gap at time 2 is then:
#
# 2*pi*h*k*delta_T/(ln(r2/r1))
# 2*pi*1*1*100/(ln(2/1)) = 906.5 watts
#
# For comparison, see results from the flux post processors
#
