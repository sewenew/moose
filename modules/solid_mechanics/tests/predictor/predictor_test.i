#The purpose of this test is to test the loadstep predictor.  This is a very
#small, monotonically loaded block of material.  If things are working right,
#the predictor should come very close to exactly nailing the solution on steps
#after the first step.  Because of nonlinear geometry, the predictor is slightly
#off in general, but that is mitigated by setting this up so that the elements
#undergo no rotations.

#The main thing to check here is that once the predictor kicks in, there are
#no iterations required.  Only the last step is output because we don't want
#to check the number of nonlinear iterations in the step where the solver actually
#has to work.
